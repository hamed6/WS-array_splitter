Python triage team
The Python triage team is a group dedicated
 towards improving workflow efficiency through
  thoughtful review and triage of open issues 
"  and pull requests. This helps contributors receive timely feedback and enables core developers to focus on reviewed items which reduces their workload. The expectations of this role expand upon the “Triager” role on the issue tracker. The responsibilities listed below are primarily centered around the Python GitHub repositories. This extends beyond CPython, and, as needed, to other repos such as devguide and core-workflow."
